Every player first has to place an igloo and then a street directly near that igloo. After the first round, the player who last placed his first igloo and street starts by placing his second igloo and street. Then he receives his first resources and after that, itâ€™s the next players turn.When the building phase is over, the normal rounds start back in the normal order. Every player first has to roll the dice and then everybody who has a building near a tile of this resource gets the corresponding resource. The player then has the possibility to build streets (1x ice, 1x fish), igloos (1x ice, 1x fish, 1x whale bone, 1x coat) or upgrade to a research station (3x coal, 2x whale bones).
